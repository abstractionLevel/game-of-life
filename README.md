# Game of Life


## Description

In the project directory, you can run:

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game.
It is a cellular automaton, and was invented
by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
This game became widely known when it was mentioned
in an article published by Scientific American in 1970.
It consists of a grid of cells which, based on
a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply.
Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various
patterns throughout the course of the game.

## Rule

1)Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.\
2)Any live cell with two or three live neighbours live on to the next generation.\
3)Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.\
4)Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
